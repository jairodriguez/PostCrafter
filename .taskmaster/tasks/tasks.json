The service includes automatic sanitization of HTML content, whitespace normalization, and intelligent default field generation from post content.\n\nField validation includes character limits for meta titles (1-60) and descriptions (0-160), focus keywords validation (0-10 keywords, 1-50 characters each), and proper validation for robots settings, canonical URLs, and primary categories. The WordPress REST API integration uses custom fields exposed by the mu-plugin with proper field mapping, error handling, request/response interceptors, and automatic retry logic.\n\nThe implementation generates default fields when needed, with methods for creating meta titles from post titles and descriptions from excerpts. Advanced features include batch field application, graceful handling of missing fields, comprehensive error handling, request ID tracking, and performance monitoring.\n\nThe YoastService integrates with post creation through the updated WordPressPostService, providing combined post creation and SEO field application with automatic default generation when fields aren't provided. Security features include sensitive data masking, input validation, malicious content detection, and comprehensive audit logging.\n\nThe implementation has been thoroughly tested with a comprehensive test suite covering all functionality, validation, sanitization, API integration, error handling, and integration with the post creation workflow. The solution is production-ready with memory-efficient processing, graceful error handling, configurable validation rules, and comprehensive logging and monitoring.\n</info added on 2025-07-23T00:18:45.154Z>",
