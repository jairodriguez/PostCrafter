The service includes automatic sanitization of HTML content, whitespace normalization, and intelligent default field generation from post content.\n\nField validation includes character limits for meta titles (1-60) and descriptions (0-160), focus keywords validation (0-10 keywords, 1-50 characters each), and proper validation for robots settings, canonical URLs, and primary categories. The WordPress REST API integration uses custom fields exposed by the mu-plugin with proper field mapping, error handling, request/response interceptors, and automatic retry logic.\n\nThe implementation generates default fields when needed, with methods for creating meta titles from post titles and descriptions from excerpts. Advanced features include batch field application, graceful handling of missing fields, comprehensive error handling, request ID tracking, and performance monitoring.\n\nThe YoastService integrates with post creation through the updated WordPressPostService, providing combined post creation and SEO field application with automatic default generation when fields aren't provided. Security features include sensitive data masking, input validation, malicious content detection, and comprehensive audit logging.\n\nThe implementation has been thoroughly tested with a comprehensive test suite covering all functionality, validation, sanitization, API integration, error handling, and integration with the post creation workflow. The solution is production-ready with memory-efficient processing, graceful error handling, configurable validation rules, and comprehensive logging and monitoring.\n</info added on 2025-07-23T00:18:45.154Z>",

Ensure proper error handling when tag creation fails.\n<info added on 2025-01-27T23:40:00.000Z>\n## Tag Creation and Management Implementation\n\nSuccessfully implemented comprehensive tag management functionality for WordPress:\n\n#### Core TagManagementService Features:\n- **Tag Creation**: Robust tag creation with validation, duplicate checking, and automatic slug generation\n- **Tag Updates**: Full update capabilities with validation and error handling\n- **Tag Search and Retrieval**: Tag search by name/ID, bulk retrieval with filtering options\n- **Tag Management**: Complete CRUD operations for WordPress tags\n- **Tag Statistics**: Advanced analytics including usage statistics and most used tags\n- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient bulk tag creation and processing\n\n#### Advanced Tag Features:\n- **getOrCreateTags()**: Intelligent tag processing that finds existing tags or creates new ones\n- **bulkCreateTags()**: Batch tag creation with partial failure handling\n- **getTagStatistics()**: Comprehensive tag usage analytics and statistics\n- **getAllTags()**: Flexible tag retrieval with filtering and sorting options\n- **findTagByName()**: Exact and fuzzy tag search capabilities\n\n#### WordPress REST API Integration:\n- **makeWordPressRequest()**: Robust HTTP client with retry logic and error handling (same as CategoryManagementService)\n- **Authentication**: Basic authentication with proper credential encoding\n- **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry for server errors (5xx) but not client errors (4xx)\n- **Request Correlation**: Request ID tracking for debugging and logging\n- **Response Transformation**: WordPress API response transformation to standardized format\n\n#### Validation and Data Integrity:\n- **Input Validation**: Uses validation functions from Task 10.1 data models\n- **Slug Generation**: Automatic URL-friendly slug creation with conflict prevention\n- **Name Sanitization**: HTML stripping and content sanitization\n- **Length Limits**: Configurable maximum lengths for names, descriptions, and slugs\n- **Reserved Slug Protection**: Prevents use of system-reserved tag slugs\n\n#### Error Handling and Logging:\n- **Structured Error Responses**: Consistent error format with codes and detailed messages\n- **Comprehensive Logging**: Request correlation, performance tracking, and debug information\n- **Operation Results**: Detailed result objects with success status, data, warnings, and errors\n- **Network Error Handling**: Timeout handling, connection errors, and retry mechanisms\n- **Validation Error Reporting**: Clear validation failure messages with specific field errors\n\n#### Tag-Specific Features:\n- **Tag Statistics**: Calculate total tags, active/unused tags, most used tags, and average posts per tag\n- **Usage Filtering**: Filter tags by minimum post count for better tag management\n- **Flat Structure**: Tags are flat (no hierarchy) unlike categories, simplifying management\n- **Bulk Processing**: Handle multiple tag operations efficiently with proper error reporting\n- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatic detection and handling of duplicate tag creation attempts\n\n#### Configuration and Flexibility:\n- **TagManagementConfig**: Configurable timeouts, retry counts, and validation options\n- **Service Factory**: Clean service instantiation with configuration injection\n- **Search Options**: Flexible search with exact matching, usage count filtering, and sorting\n- **Environment Adaptability**: Supports different WordPress installations and configurations\n\n#### Performance and Analytics:\n- **Tag Usage Analytics**: Detailed statistics on tag usage patterns and trends\n- **Most Used Tags**: Ranking system for identifying popular tags\n- **Unused Tag Detection**: Identify tags that are not assigned to any posts\n- **Performance Metrics**: Tag operation timing and success rates\n- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple tag operations\n\n#### Security and Safety Features:\n- **Input Sanitization**: Prevents XSS and injection attacks through tag names/descriptions\n- **Authentication Security**: Secure credential handling and transmission\n- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents hanging requests and resource exhaustion\n- **Validation Security**: Comprehensive input validation with security focus\n- **Error Information Security**: Controlled error message exposure\n\n#### Testing Strategy:\n- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite covering all service methods and edge cases\n- **Mocking**: WordPress API mocking for isolated testing\n- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, API errors, validation failures, and edge cases\n- **Authentication Tests**: Credential encoding and authorization header verification\n- **Retry Logic Tests**: Server error retry behavior and client error non-retry verification\n- **Statistics Tests**: Tag analytics and usage calculation testing\n- **Bulk Operation Tests**: Multi-tag creation and processing scenarios\n\n#### Key Implementation Files:\n- **`src/services/tag-management.ts`**: Main TagManagementService implementation (850+ lines)\n- **`src/services/__tests__/tag-management.test.ts`**: Comprehensive test suite (600+ lines)\n- **Integration with existing taxonomy types**: Uses interfaces from Task 10.1 data models\n- **Consistent with CategoryManagementService**: Similar patterns and error handling\n\nThe implementation provides a production-ready tag management system that complements the category management functionality and integrates seamlessly with WordPress REST API while maintaining data integrity, security, and performance.\n</info added on 2025-01-27T23:40:00.000Z>",
