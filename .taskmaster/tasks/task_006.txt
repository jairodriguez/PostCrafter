# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement secure authentication system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up secure API key authentication between GPT and the Vercel endpoint to prevent unauthorized access
# Details:
Implement secure API key validation middleware. Store API keys securely in Vercel environment variables. Add rate limiting and request validation to prevent abuse and ensure only authorized GPT instances can publish posts.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication with valid and invalid API keys, verify rate limiting works correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement API key validation middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware to validate API keys from request headers
### Details:
Create middleware function to extract and validate API keys from request headers. Compare against stored API keys in environment variables. Return appropriate error responses for invalid or missing keys.

## 2. Set up secure environment variable handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure secure storage and access to API keys in Vercel
### Details:
Set up environment variables in Vercel for API key storage. Implement secure access patterns and validation. Ensure API keys are never logged or exposed in error messages.

## 3. Implement rate limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse
### Details:
Implement rate limiting based on API key and IP address. Set reasonable limits for requests per minute/hour. Use Vercel's edge functions or external rate limiting service.

## 4. Add request validation and sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive request validation
### Details:
Add validation for request headers, body format, and content types. Sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks. Validate request size limits and content structure.

## 5. Implement security headers and CORS [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add security headers and proper CORS configuration
### Details:
Set up security headers including Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options. Configure CORS to allow only necessary origins and methods.

## 6. Add request logging and monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secure logging for authentication events
### Details:
Add logging for authentication attempts, rate limit violations, and security events. Ensure sensitive data is not logged. Set up monitoring for suspicious activity patterns.
