# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create monitoring and analytics dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Build a simple dashboard to monitor API usage, successful publishes, and error rates
# Details:
Create a basic dashboard that shows API usage statistics, successful post publishes, error rates, and recent activity. This will help users monitor their PostCrafter usage and troubleshoot any issues.

# Test Strategy:
Verify dashboard displays accurate statistics and real-time data

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement metrics collection service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a service to collect and store API usage metrics, successful publishes, error rates, and user activity data
### Details:
Develop a TypeScript service that captures metrics from API calls and stores them in a database or file system. Implement functions to track API calls, successful publishes, errors, and user activity. Set up a simple data schema for storing metrics with timestamps, user identifiers, and relevant metadata. Configure the service to run alongside the main API and capture metrics in real-time.

## 2. Create data visualization components [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop reusable chart and graph components to visualize the collected metrics data
### Details:
Using a JavaScript visualization library (like Chart.js, D3.js, or Recharts), create reusable components for line charts, bar graphs, and summary cards. Implement components for displaying API usage over time, success/error rates, and activity logs. Ensure components are responsive and can handle different data formats from the metrics service.

## 3. Build dashboard UI layout and navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the overall dashboard layout, navigation, and responsive UI framework
### Details:
Create a responsive dashboard layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox. Implement a navigation system for different dashboard sections (Overview, API Usage, Publishes, Errors, Activity). Design a clean, modern UI with appropriate spacing, typography, and color scheme. Include header with title and user info, sidebar for navigation, and main content area for metrics display.

## 4. Implement real-time data updates and filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Add functionality for real-time dashboard updates and user filtering options
### Details:
Implement WebSocket or polling mechanism to update dashboard data in real-time. Add date range selectors for historical data viewing. Create filtering options for specific metrics, error types, or publishing platforms. Implement data refresh controls and loading indicators. Add user preferences storage to remember filter settings.

## 5. Create alert system and exportable reports [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.4
### Description: Implement alert notifications for critical metrics and exportable dashboard reports
### Details:
Add configurable threshold alerts for error rates, API usage limits, and other critical metrics. Implement in-dashboard notifications and optional email alerts. Create functionality to export dashboard data as CSV or PDF reports. Add scheduled report generation and delivery options. Implement a notification center to manage and view all alerts.
