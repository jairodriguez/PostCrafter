# Task ID: 14
# Title: End-to-end testing and optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the entire workflow from GPT to published WordPress post
# Details:
Test the complete workflow from ChatGPT to published WordPress post. Test various content types, image scenarios, SEO configurations, and error conditions. Optimize performance and ensure reliability.

# Test Strategy:
Execute full workflow tests with various content types and verify all features work correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create comprehensive test plan for end-to-end workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a detailed test plan that covers all aspects of the workflow from ChatGPT to WordPress publishing, including test cases for different content types, edge cases, and error scenarios.
### Details:
Create a test matrix covering: 1) Different post types (standard, with images, with custom fields), 2) Various SEO configurations through Yoast, 3) Error conditions (network failures, invalid inputs, authentication issues), 4) Performance benchmarks for response times. Document expected outcomes for each test case and create a checklist for verification.

## 2. Implement automated testing suite for core functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create automated tests to verify the core functionality of the system, focusing on the integration between GPT, the Vercel endpoint, and WordPress.
### Details:
Develop Jest tests that mock GPT requests and verify correct handling by the Vercel endpoint. Create integration tests that use a test WordPress instance to verify post creation, image handling, and metadata processing. Include tests for authentication, input validation, and error handling. Set up CI pipeline to run tests automatically.

## 3. Perform load and stress testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Test the system under various load conditions to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure reliability under stress.
### Details:
Use tools like k6 or Apache JMeter to simulate concurrent requests at different volumes. Test with gradually increasing load to identify breaking points. Monitor server response times, memory usage, and error rates. Test WordPress API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling if needed. Document performance metrics and optimize based on findings.

## 4. Optimize image processing and handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Review and optimize the image processing workflow to ensure efficient handling of different image types, sizes, and quantities.
### Details:
Analyze current image processing implementation for bottlenecks. Implement image compression before upload if not already present. Add caching for processed images. Optimize parallel processing of multiple images. Test with various image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP) and sizes to ensure consistent handling. Implement fallback mechanisms for failed image uploads.

## 5. Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Enhance error handling throughout the system to gracefully manage failures and provide clear feedback to users.
### Details:
Review all API calls and add proper try/catch blocks with specific error messages. Implement retry logic for transient failures (e.g., network issues). Create a centralized error logging system that captures detailed context. Develop user-friendly error messages for ChatGPT to relay to users. Add transaction rollback for partial failures to maintain data consistency.

## 6. Conduct security review and implement performance optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4, 14.5
### Description: Perform a comprehensive security review of the entire system and implement final performance optimizations before production deployment.
### Details:
Conduct security audit focusing on authentication, input validation, and data sanitization. Implement rate limiting if not already present. Review and optimize database queries. Add appropriate caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. Minimize API calls to WordPress. Implement request batching where appropriate. Document security measures and performance optimizations for future reference.
