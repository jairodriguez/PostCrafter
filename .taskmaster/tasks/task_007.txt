# Task ID: 7
# Title: Add error handling and logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring for the API to ensure reliability and debugging capability
# Details:
Add structured error handling for all API endpoints. Implement logging for debugging and monitoring. Handle WordPress API errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages back to GPT. Add request/response logging for troubleshooting.

# Test Strategy:
Test various error scenarios and verify proper error messages and logging

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create error handling middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a centralized error handling middleware that catches and processes all errors in a consistent way across the application
### Details:
Create a middleware function that catches errors thrown in route handlers using Express's error handling middleware pattern. Implement different error classes (ValidationError, AuthenticationError, WordPressAPIError, etc.) to categorize errors. The middleware should format error responses consistently with appropriate HTTP status codes and clear error messages.

## 2. Implement structured logging system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a structured logging system that captures important application events with appropriate log levels
### Details:
Integrate a logging library like Winston or Pino. Configure log levels (error, warn, info, debug) and structured JSON output format. Set up log rotation and retention policies. Create logger utility functions for consistent logging across the application. Configure different outputs based on environment (console for development, file for production).

## 3. Add request/response logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement middleware to log all incoming requests and outgoing responses for debugging and monitoring purposes
### Details:
Create middleware that logs request details (method, path, query parameters, headers, body) and response details (status code, response time, size). Use the structured logging system implemented in 7.2. Ensure sensitive information like API keys are redacted from logs. Add correlation IDs to track requests through the system.

## 4. Implement WordPress API error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create specific error handling for WordPress API interactions to gracefully handle and report WordPress-specific errors
### Details:
Implement specific error handling for WordPress API calls that catches HTTP errors, authentication failures, and WordPress-specific error responses. Parse WordPress error messages and translate them into user-friendly messages. Implement retry logic for transient errors. Map WordPress error codes to appropriate HTTP status codes for client responses.

## 5. Set up application monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement monitoring to track application health, performance metrics, and error rates
### Details:
Integrate with a monitoring service (like Datadog, New Relic, or a simple health check endpoint). Track key metrics including request rates, error rates, response times, and WordPress API call performance. Set up alerting for critical errors or performance degradation. Create a health check endpoint that verifies connectivity to WordPress API.

## 6. Create debugging tools and documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Implement debugging utilities and document troubleshooting procedures for the application
### Details:
Create utility endpoints for debugging (only accessible in development or with admin credentials). Implement verbose logging mode that can be enabled for troubleshooting. Document common error scenarios and their solutions. Create a troubleshooting guide for operators. Implement a way to correlate logs with specific requests using request IDs.
