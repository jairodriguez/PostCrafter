# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement input validation and sanitization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent security issues
# Details:
Implement validation for all input fields including content sanitization, URL validation for images, and proper escaping of HTML content. Ensure all data is properly validated before being sent to WordPress to prevent security vulnerabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various input types including malicious content to ensure proper validation and sanitization

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create input validation utility functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop reusable utility functions for common validation tasks such as string length checking, type validation, and pattern matching
### Details:
Create a validation.js utility file with functions for validating different data types: validateString(str, minLength, maxLength), validateEmail(email), validateUrl(url), validateNumber(num, min, max), and isValidJson(str). These functions should return boolean values and optionally error messages. Use regular expressions for pattern matching where appropriate.

## 2. Implement content sanitization for HTML and markdown [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create sanitization functions to clean user-generated content and prevent XSS attacks
### Details:
Implement sanitizeHtml(content) and sanitizeMarkdown(content) functions using libraries like DOMPurify or markdown-it with appropriate configuration to strip dangerous HTML tags, attributes, and JavaScript. Configure allowlists for safe HTML elements and attributes. Handle special characters and ensure proper encoding.

## 3. Add URL and image validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement specific validation for URLs and image sources to prevent malicious redirects and ensure proper formatting
### Details:
Create validateImageUrl(url) function that checks if URLs are properly formatted, use allowlists for accepted domains if applicable, verify file extensions match image types (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and implement size validation if needed. Consider implementing async validation to check if images actually exist.

## 4. Implement input field validation middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create middleware to validate all incoming request data before processing
### Details:
Develop an Express middleware function validateRequestBody(schema) that validates incoming request bodies against predefined schemas. Use a schema validation library like Joi or Yup to define validation rules for each API endpoint. The middleware should reject requests with invalid data and return appropriate error messages.

## 5. Add WordPress-specific data sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Implement sanitization specific to WordPress API requirements for post content, titles, and metadata
### Details:
Create sanitizeWordPressContent(content) and sanitizeWordPressFields(fields) functions that prepare data specifically for WordPress. Handle WordPress-specific requirements like shortcode validation, proper escaping for post_content, post_title, and meta fields. Ensure compatibility with Gutenberg blocks if used.

## 6. Implement comprehensive security testing suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Create automated tests to verify all validation and sanitization measures are working correctly
### Details:
Develop a test suite that includes security-focused tests: XSS attack vectors, SQL injection attempts, CSRF scenarios, and other common web vulnerabilities. Include both unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for the complete request flow. Document common attack vectors being tested and mitigation strategies.
