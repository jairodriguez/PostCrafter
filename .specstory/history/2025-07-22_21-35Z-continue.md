I can see you have a comprehensive PostCrafter project with tasks already set up in Taskmaster. Let me check the current status and help you continue with the next steps.

Great! I can see your PostCrafter project is well-structured with comprehensive tasks. Let me check what the next logical task to work on is:


---



---

Perfect! I can see that Task 2 (Create Vercel serverless API structure) is the next logical task to work on, and it's almost complete. Looking at the subtasks, only subtask 2.6 (Create development and deployment scripts) is still pending. Let me check the current state of the Vercel API project and complete this final subtask.

| 📄 `vercel.json` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json` |

</details>

---

Read file: vercel-api/package.json

---

Excellent! I can see that the development and deployment scripts are already well-implemented in the `package.json`. Let me check if there are any additional deployment configurations or scripts that need to be created:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory vercel-api/.vercel • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| 📄 `dev.json` |

</details>

---

Read file: vercel-api/.vercel/dev.json

---

Now let me check if there are any additional deployment scripts or documentation that should be created:


---

Read file: vercel-api/README.md

---

Let me continue reading the README to see the complete development and deployment documentation:


---

Read file: vercel-api/README.md

---

Let me check the rest of the README to see the complete deployment documentation:


---

Read file: vercel-api/README.md

---

Perfect! I can see that the development and deployment scripts are already comprehensively implemented. The project has:

1. ✅ Complete npm scripts for development, testing, and deployment
2. ✅ Vercel CLI configuration and deployment workflows
3. ✅ Comprehensive documentation in README.md
4. ✅ Environment variable management scripts
5. ✅ Local development configuration
6. ✅ Production deployment instructions

Let me mark this subtask as complete and then check if we can move on to the next major task:


---



---

Now let me mark the main task 2 as complete since all subtasks are done:


---



---

Excellent! Now I can see that Task 6 (Implement secure authentication system) is the next logical task to work on. However, I notice that many of the subtasks in Task 6 are actually already implemented in the Vercel API project we just completed. Let me check what's already been done and what still needs to be implemented:


---

Read file: vercel-api/src/middleware/auth.ts

---

Read file: vercel-api/src/middleware/cors.ts

---

I can see that much of Task 6 is already implemented! Let me check what specific subtasks are actually pending by looking at the current implementation more closely. Let me update the task to reflect what's already been done:
